# lepk
Lepk is my collection of single header libraries. So basically a ripoff of [nothings stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb).

Every library has a test built into the header. These tests are ran with test.c and a Makefile.

Everything is written in pedantic C99.

## Current libraries
| Library | Version | Usage |
| - | - | - |
| [lepk_da.h](lepk_da.h) | 1.0 | Dynamic arrays. | 
| [lepk_window.h](lepk_window.h) | 1.1 | Windowing library. |
